## 🌟 **Project Overview**

In a world where road accidents are a growing concern, the **Automatic Speed Limitation System** presents a transformative solution. By integrating **real-time data processing**, **pedestrian detection**, and **traffic sign recognition**, this system dynamically adjusts vehicle speeds to enhance safety and minimize accident risks.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **🔍 Pedestrian & Cyclist Detection**  
  Utilizes computer vision and machine learning to identify pedestrians and cyclists in real-time, adjusting vehicle behavior to enhance safety.

- **⚡ Speed Limitation**  
  Enforces speed limits (typically 15-25 mph in urban and school zones) to protect vulnerable road users and ensure safer travel in busy environments.

- **🔄 Reverse Detection**  
  Detects obstacles while reversing and takes corrective actions, such as stopping or reducing speed, to prevent collisions.

- **🧠 Precision in Motion (Aug. 2023 – Jan. 2024)**  
  - Designed and trained **3 CNN models** using a dataset of **51,839 images** across **43 classes**, improving object detection in diverse weather conditions.
  - The **third model**, with enhanced filter counts and a deeper fully connected layer, achieved **93% accuracy**.
  - Enhanced **road safety** by accurately predicting highway signboards under various environmental factors, contributing to better navigation systems.

## 🛠 **Methodology**

The system combines advanced technologies:
- **Computer Vision**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Transportation Engineering**

Leveraging datasets from Kaggle's Self-Driving Cars Dataset, the USA Traffic Light Dataset, and a custom dataset, the system processes data from vehicle cameras and sensors. Algorithms analyze this data in real-time to detect pedestrians, cyclists, objects in reverse, and traffic signs.
